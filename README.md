- At the main menu, the user only can type values between 0 - 5. These are the options shown at the menu
- Each game has its own Id, it is used to identify the game and update it when needed.
- For each case the user will be prompted to use the console input.
- The application will be running indefinitely until the used decides to stop it
- If the user does not provide a valid country, the program will keep asking for one until one is provided
